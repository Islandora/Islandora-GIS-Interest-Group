## Attendees

## Notes

### Use Cases for Islandora GIS Data Modeling and Solution Pack(s)

@kimpham54 structured and submitted the following use cases:

* [Issue #11](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-GIS-Interest-Group/issues/11)
* [Issue #12](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-GIS-Interest-Group/issues/12)

@jrgriffiniii will implement integration tests covering both of these test cases

Regarding component B. of Issue #12, @jrgriffiniii has been parsing embedded metadata from GeoTIFF's using the ExifTool

_This data has been structured within <dc:coverage> elements in compliance with the DCMI Point Scheme_

[Please see line islandora_gis.module](https://github.com/LafayetteCollegeLibraries/islandora_dss_solution_pack_gis/blob/master/islandora_gis/islandora_gis.module#L454)

### Reviewing the Fedora Commons 4 PCDM data modeling

Addressing the issue of data modeling for Fedora Commons 4 within Islandora 2.x
Islandora 2.x Node bundle fields should properly map to Hydra Model attributes (in order to maintain some basic degree of parity)
_@jrgriffiniii has created an [issue](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Fedora4-Interest-Group/issues/24) in relation to this topic_

Much of these bundle fields should be generated using metadata elements specified within the FGDC or ISO 19139 standards
Ideally, the same fields would also be indexed by Apache Solr in both those cases for GeoBlacklight and Islandora 2.x/apache_solr

### Status of the Vagrant Environments

@jrgriffiniii has made more progress with the Puppet/Vagrant solutions for the Fedora Commons and Fedora Generic Search environments
Feedback for these solutions has been captured within the following thread on the "islandora-dev" mailing list:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/islandora-dev/puppet/islandora-dev/X_43qK18-JA/7wQ3DRfTTIUJ

As a consequence of this progress, the Islandora Puppet/Vagrant solution should be relatively straightforward to implement

### Emerging Islandora GIS Solutions for Lafayette College Libraries

#### islandora\_gis\_timeline
https://github.com/LafayetteCollegeLibraries/islandora_dss_solution_pack_gis/tree/master/islandora_gis_timeline

This solution serves to integrate the SIMILE Timeline widget
Provides the ability to link "Event" attributes in relation to geospatial features on a geovisualization interface

#### Complex Symbolization Use Cases
http://sites.lafayette.edu/dss/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-11-07-at-11.09.48-AM.png

@jrgriffiniii outlined a number of more complex use cases dealing with the problems involving extensive symbolization logic
One such case (a dot density plot) required that the PDF of a specific random distribution be utilized to dynamically calculate the location of and render additional vector points on a given map using certain Shapefile attribute values
This, unfortunately, is not only a feature which is not offered by OpenLayers, but consumes significant browser resources
The response in this case was to perform the visualization using a propriety desktop application, and to then generate a raster layer for the visualization

#### Crowdsourcing Geospatial Data Capture
https://github.com/LafayetteCollegeLibraries/islandora_dss_solution_pack_gis/tree/master/islandora_dss_gis_crowdsourcing

@jrgriffiniii also outlined the requests for a "crowdsourcing" solution for the Lafayette College Libraries
In response to these requests, functionality enabling the "geotagging" of Islandora Objects (e. g. GeoTIFF's) using a mapping interface must be implemented
Additionally, the ability to structure these "geotag" data sets as Shapefiles, and then ingest these into Islandora for persistent has been requested
This is at the very early stages of development, and other issues shall likely become higher priorities
