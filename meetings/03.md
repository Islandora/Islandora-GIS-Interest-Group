## May 8, 2015 10:00AM - 11:00AM Pacific (01:00PM - 02:00PM Eastern, 02:00PM - 03:00PM Atlantic)

## Agenda

1. Call for Agenda Items
2. Scheduling for the Islandora GIS Interest Group
  1. Restructuring of the Interest Group roles
    1. James must resign as the convenor of the Islandora GIS Interest Group due to constraints upon temporal and other resources
  2. Next Meeting
    1. June 12 , 2015
3. Integrating GIS Services and Islandora ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lK484HouAJTB5I-NRDrTQNMII4UEiivjOKsP4rZHm7Q/edit?usp=sharing))
  1. Status of the Vagrant Environments
    1. Vagrant boxes released in a more stable condition on HashiCorp's Atlas
	  1. [jrgriffiniii/fedora-gsearch](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/jrgriffiniii/boxes/fedora-gsearch)
	  2. [jrgriffiniii/islandora](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/jrgriffiniii/boxes/islandora)
	  3. [jrgriffiniii/islandora-gis](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/jrgriffiniii/boxes/islandora-gis)
  2. Testing within the Vagrant Environments
    1. Puppet is used for provisioning
	2. Vagrant is used to manage the VM's
	  1. Boxes are then generated and released on Atlas
    3. Capturing feedback is necessary
	  1. Refactor issues as functional test suites
	  2. Implementing Behat testing suites for these boxes ensures a consistency in environments
  3. Geospatial data management and discovery
    1. GeoBlacklight and GeoCombine offer resources
	  1. XSLT's for transforming geospatial metadata (e. g. FGDC and ISO 19139 Documents) are actively developed
	  2. *This only yields forth JSON Objects*
	2. How is this to be managed moving forward with Fedora Commons 4?
	  1. Would a service integrate (or, an extension be developed) for Apache Camel?
  4. Interfacing with external web services
    1. Neatline
	  1. Institutional use cases have arisen for integrating geospatial data sets from Neatline into Islandora or Fedora Commons
	  2. Currently, Neatline/Omeka only offers integration using the [FedoraConnector plugin](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/fedoraconnector/)
	    1. This does not appear to support integration for vectorized data sets aggregated using Neatline
	  3. Nick Ruest has seen success in interfacing between Islandora and assets managed in Omeka
	2. Anomalous data sets
	  1. LIDAR data sets
	    1. Not traditionally geospatial, but many similar use cases arise (e. g. interfacing with an external web service to render bitstream content)
