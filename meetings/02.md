## Notes

### User Stories/Use Cases

#### Tools for Managing User Stories/Use Cases

* GitHub?
* Islandora JIRA?
* Another service (i. e. LucidChart)?

Donald Moses:
GitHub is preferred as a solution, particularly following the Fedora 4 approach which involves the capturing of stories as issues.

James:
New Lafayette College Libraries use case involves LiDAR data sets
[PoTree Project](http://potree.org/) is currently being evaluated for the service used to render the point clouds

Donald also has a strong use case for LiDAR data sets

Donald:
Direction for the use case templates
Hydra Labs: templates (actor, scope, level, user story associated with it)

#### Implementing Acceptance Tests using the User Stories/Use Cases

James:
Proposes structuring acceptance tests using [Behat](http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/) from the user stories:


The limitation of this is such that running these test suites on a continuous integration service (e. g. TravisCI) is fairly slow

James: Proposes integrating with Existing Vagrant/BASH Environment for Islandora (i. e. the solution released by Nick Ruest)

Alternative:
Use the existing Vagrant/Puppet Environment for Islandora developed for Lafayette College Libraries
Progress is slow; James shared the current boxes for [Cartaro](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/jrgriffiniii/boxes/cartaro) and [GeoServer](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/jrgriffiniii/boxes/geoserver)
(James: The provisioning system should be approached with caution, as Pat indicated that they would be working with Ansible and Donald clarified that the intended Vagrant approach involving Chef for provisioning fell back to BASH)

##### Actionable Items
* James: Raise questions regarding Fedora Commons 3.8.x (and prior releases) for the Vagrant/BASH environment
If this is not supported, then at least Lafayette College Libraries shall need to work exclusively with Fedora Commons <= 3.8.x solutions
Look to share work modeled Behat for a demonstration of this approach (preferably, integrating a Vagrant box)

### Geospatial Discovery

James:
No significant updates on the approach using the XSL Stylesheet offered by GeoHydra

In response to the work of Chris Beer at Stanford regarding the potential integration of [LDPath](http://wiki.apache.org/marmotta/LDPath) support for linked data, looking to either parse geohashes specified in linked data or looking to ultimately push for supporting querying linked geospatial data sets using [GeoSPARQL](http://www.geosparql.org/) might hold some value

##### Actionable Items
* Bring this into the focus of the Fedora 4 Community

### Geovisualization Widgets

#### OpenLayers and Leaflet

James:
Concern over the direction and interest in Leaflet development from the [GeoBlacklight](http://geoblacklight.org/) community
While the Drupal community does popularly support OpenLayers, there may be some cases more specific to solutions integrated with Fedora Commons which are handled by extending Leaflet functionality

Donald:
OpenLayers shows some significant strengths regarding the degree of integration with Drupal core functionality
Further, the range of functionality which is offered by Cartaro certainly supercedes any degree of integration offered by members of the Drupal community managing the "leaflet" Module
However, in response to the resource shared by Kim, Leaflet could still offer quite some development partners

Pat shared a [pertinent discussion regarding the libraries](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/33918/should-i-use-openlayers-or-leaflet)

As Kim shared, the Leaflet development community appears to have extended the functionality using [plugins](http://leafletjs.com/plugins.html) to quite some extent

##### Actionable Items
* Identify the relative strengths for Leaflet and Cartaro/OpenLayers based approach
