## Terms of Reference

* This Islandora Interest Group is named the Islandora GIS Interest Group
* The purpose of the Islandora GIS Interest Group is the following:
  * To address the preservation, access, and discovery of geospatial data sets (these data sets, not being limited to but including Esri Shapefiles [vector data sets] and images in the GeoTIFF [raster data sets]).
  * To enable and structure descriptive and technical metadata for these data sets (including the usage of ISO 19139-compliant XML Documents referred to as "Federal Geographic Data Committee" (FGDC) Documents and MODS Documents)
  * To explore and define a series of best practices for the generation of common and open standards for the serialization of entities within geospatial data sets (such as the Keyhole Markup Language Documents and GeoJSON Objects)
  * To capture and manage user stories involving the management of geospatial metadata, and to refactor these into feature or improvement requests for solutions to be implemented by the Islandora Community
